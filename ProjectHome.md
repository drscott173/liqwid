Liqwid is a music visualizer for Flash based on Milkdrop, a visualization engine created by Ryan Geiss in the late 1990's.  Liqwid is compatible with Milkdrop version 1.0 and can play thousands of presets, reproducing the breathtaking views that have to be seen live.  Liqwid extends Milkdrop with support for pictures, video, a webcam, and sharing snapshots and presets online.  Waveforms, borders and pictures can also take advantage of Flash capabilities such as blur filters, glow filters, and Perlin noise.  Liqwid transitions between pictures using the standard "edge" wipe effects from the Society of Television and Motion Picture Engineers.

Liqwid comes with a plugin for the popular JW FLV Player available at longtailvideo.com, as well as a plugin for mashing up the latest pictures from Flickr with a music playlist from Project Playlist.
